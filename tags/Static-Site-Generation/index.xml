By nature, blog posts are updated very rarely. Static pages are easy to archive or download &amp;ndash; for instance you can find the earliest snapshot from 2018 working via the wayback machine here. All modern static site engines allow for writing in Markdown, making it easy for me to add posts.
In the past, I used Jekyll as my go-to, recently however I moved to Hugo.</description></item><item><title>Pagination with Jekyll and Foundation Sites 6</title><link>https://chrisk91.me/post/2018-09-09-Pagination-with-Jekyll-and-Foundation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chrisk91.me/post/2018-09-09-Pagination-with-Jekyll-and-Foundation/</guid><description>Prerequisites This post assumes, that you already have a site running. It&amp;rsquo;s also a good idea to run bundle update, to get your dependencies up to date. I will utilize the Jekyll pagination plugin which is available on GitHub pages, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to build your site locally.
Important: the plugin only works when your posts are listed on your index.html page, this is a restriction of GitHub pages, which bundles jekyll-paginate in version 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
