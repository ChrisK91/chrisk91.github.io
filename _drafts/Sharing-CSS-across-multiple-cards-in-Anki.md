title: Sharing CSS across multiple cards in Anki
keypoints: | 
    - We will create a basic CSS file in Ankis media folder
    - We will then integrate this CSS file in a number of cards
    - A few caveats are pointed out
blurb: Tired of copying and pasting various CSS snippets across multiple cards? By using the CSS `@include`, you can share the same CSS file across multiple cards.

In Anki, we have the ability to edit the CSS of individual cards.
